	5 years. That's how much time has passed since I last created a level in a full-length game. And honestly, I somehow managed to forget how much I flat-out enjoyed it. Doesn't everyone have that one activity which they enjoy doing more then they probably should? Mine just happens to be level design, a fact that I've struggled to remember over the last few years.
	<br><br>
	Actually, it may not be so much that I forgot about it, but more that a series of events drove me away from it over the last few years. Up until this point, I was honestly putting off the development of the first level in our game. I don't know why, except somehow I ended up with the idea in my mind that it was going to be incredibly tedious. Having put in a fair amount of time into the creation of the level now, I would consider it anything but.
	<br><br>
	So I started thinking back to my previous games to try and remember why I had such a low interest in level design recently. I clearly remembered it being my favorite part of creating my previous games, so when did I give it the chance to rub me the wrong way? The answer became pretty obvious when I realized the last time I worked on a major project, the infamous final 10% of my largest project ever. Play-testing, cleaning up levels, fixing bugs, adding scenery, minor tweaks and improvements; all things that I considered extremely tedious at the time despite being very important. That was it, completing my previous game had made me decide to take a break; but, it wasn't just that. I didn't get to do very much level design in that last 10% either. All I could remember when I finished, was all the grinding that I had to do at the end of the game, as opposed to the fun parts I got to do throughout.

	  30 long levels, 7 bosses, 60 hidden bonus coins and a bonus world.<br>
	  Pretty ambitious for a kid who didn't know how to write a function.
	</p>
</div>

<p class="p-end">
	But let's backtrack a little more first because I can't fully place the blame on that last 10%. I have a very bad habit of wanting all of the art and music for a level before actually developing it (let's say for inspiration purposes). Now when I was creating fan-games with Game Maker, this wasn't a huge issue. I just hit up <a target="_blank" href="http://vgmusic.com">VG Music</a> to get the music, and <a target="_blank" href="http://spriters-resource.com">Spriters Resource</a> to get the art. Now that only got me so far, but <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dkc-atlas.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=972&sid=595f4b5ab5ca0be0ca0088f148907293">thanks to the help of awesome strangers on the internet</a>, I managed to put together my assets piece by piece. Matching tilesets and backgrounds were a bit harder to come by though, and I probably wasted hours upon hours looking for good artwork for my game. This increased my development time by ridiculous amounts and to put it simply, it was tedious.
	<br><br>
	This focus of developing levels with the proper graphics first slowed my development to a crawl, unfortunately I didn't notice that until pretty much just now. And the only reason I noticed was because I found myself making the exact same mistakes and doing the exact same things all over again this time around. Initially I was trying to make this game by myself, artwork and everything. It wasn't until Jason came on board and made me realize that what I was doing wasn't necessary or smart. It was time for me to ditch my ego and, instead of trying to do it all myself, leave the art to a professional. This is easily the smartest decision I could have made as it allows me to focus on the things I actually excel at, development and level design. The best part is, I can already notice it making an improvement.
	<br><br>
	I always considered game development something that I could do on my own, but realistically it shouldn't be. I'll be able to make a better quality game by learning to properly use my team's strengths instead. A one man show is really convenient at first, until you realize how much time you're wasting by doing it.
