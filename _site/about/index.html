				Pebbles is a newly formed indie game development studio based out of Toronto, Ontario. We are currently developing our first game which is still lacking an official name, but you can tag along as our concepts become realities. Follow our <a href="/">blog</a> to get updates about the design and development of the game as we create it.

							I can't even remember how long I've been making games for, it's been too long. I initially learned to program by making them and I still make game engines to teach myself new coding languages. You can actually see my skills develop over the years by playing my previous games. They go from <a target="_blank" href="http://sandbox.yoyogames.com/games/6056-super-bowser">horribly ghetto</a>, to <a target="_blank" href="http://sandbox.yoyogames.com/games/82-super-baron-bros">maybe a bit better</a>, until we finally get to <a target="_blank" href="http://sandbox.yoyogames.com/games/159275-donkey-kong-country-4---the-dk-bay">actually a decent game</a>.
							<br><br>
							If you look at the dates on those games, you'll notice I haven't made anything in almost 5 years. That's because I released the last one just before going to university to actually learn how to code (I didn't know what a function was in high school). I got MUCH more experienced during my time in university and even managed to land myself a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/~apennell/google/intro.html">Google internship</a>.
							<br><br>
							Now I'm finishing school and I've decided to chase the dream that got me into being a programmer in the first place. The difference is that now I'm no longer a kid killing time by sitting in front of a computer screen. I'm a professional developer trying to make my way into an industry which I've been learning about for years.

							I am a rapper/poet/music producer/political slacktivist/monster on the beats/man with a lot of opinions/genius/idiot.  I got more slashes than a Sandslash battle and more skills than a trades college… WHAT!!!!! The quickest way to find out about me is to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMHHPBaiRk">check my music</a>.
							<br><br>
							Now for those of you who didn't get distracted by the "Related Videos" after clicking the Youtube link and are still reading this, here is a bit more about me.  I go by Philosofly.  I like to think I put the "Swag" in social awareness.  I believe in saying meaningful things (Philoso-) but looking good while doing it (-fly).  I like making trippy sounding boundary pushing beats.  I am a fiend for anything that sounds new and different.  I like to rap about important global socio-political issues because, as an average ass powerless Toronto citizen watching from the sidelines, it feels like the only way I can have my opinions heard. I am also an accomplished spoken word poet that has won various competitions across Canada, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/361945">including the national title in 2013 at the Canadian Festival of Spoken Word</a>.
							<br><br>
              The biggest thing me and Alex have in common is our love of video games (especially 2D platformers). So when he presented me with an opportunity to combine my love of music, storytelling, and video games in a dopetastic, juicy, sweet morsel of digital heavenliness… I jumped at the opportunity.

							We still need another 3rd of our team. Both of our current members are pros in their respective field. Unfortunately art design isn't something that either of them are good at. World domination requires at least a group of three, that's why Pinky and the Brain always failed.
