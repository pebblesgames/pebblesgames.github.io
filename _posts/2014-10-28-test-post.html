	Let's be honest, no one ignores the test post. Unfortunately, there isn't much to show off about the game this early, or rather, there isn't much I want to show off about the game this early. So for now let's just talk about the type of game which we are trying to create.
	<br><br>
	To simplify it in terms of genre, it will be a high speed 2D action platformer with a heavy focus on integrated storytelling. I'm personally not a big fan of interrupting gameplay to present a storyline as it destroys the player's immersion. I love it when a game can properly deliver a story without having the player watch a cutscene or read text for hours on end. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.supergiantgames.com/games/bastion/">Bastion</a> achieved this with flying colors and based on the success and critical acclaim of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stanleyparable.com/">The Stanley Parable</a>, it has become obvious that consumers enjoy this method of storytelling in video games, even if there isn't much depth to the gameplay.

	If you look at my <a target="_blank" href="/about/">previous games</a>, you will notice that I have a lot of history making action platformers. I figured that there was no reason to switch to a genre which I don't have as much experience with. Instead I opted expand what is my favorite genre by experimenting with narrative instead. Expanding on our predecessors isn't exactly hard, when was the last time there was an actual story in a Mario or Rayman game? We as players always just accepted that action platformers generally don't need a storyline, or at least not a good one. This formula has been fine for a long time, but it's about time we broke out of that mold and explore what a 2d platformer could be.
	<br><br>
	Now let me just take a break here and clarify what I mean by an action platformer, because some people may not be able to discern the difference between types of 2D platformers. In one hand you have your puzzle platformers, think <a target="_blank" href="http://braid-game.com/">Braid</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://fezgame.com/">Fez</a>. I find that there is an oversaturation of these in the indie game market due to the fact that they are low cost to develop. While I do enjoy these games, I know I'm not alone when I say I prefer a more uptempo gameplay most of the time. Which brings me to the other hand, action platformers (think Mario, DKC or Sonic). These games typically are less based on solving puzzles and more focused on using the game physics to complete levels. Unfortunately, there are not as many of these games being made in the indie world. We occasionally get games like <a target="_blank" href="http://yachtclubgames.com/shovel-knight/">Shovel Knight</a> but it seems like a genre which is mostly being supported through games by major publishers like <a target="_blank" href="http://newsupermariobrosu.nintendo.com/">New Super Mario Bros</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://donkeykong.nintendo.com/tropical-freeze/">Donkey Kong Country</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://rayman.ubi.com/legends/en-gb/home/">Rayman</a>.
	<br><br>
	Based on the number of games in this genre being made, you could assume that they don't have very good sales, however its quite the opposite. All the action platformer games I just listed were critically acclaimed upon release and sold very well. Even just looking at the only indie game example I gave, Shovel Knight sold <a target="_blank" href="http://yachtclubgames.com/2014/08/sales-one-month/">180,000</a> copies in its first month available. So why aren't more of these games being made? Hell if I know, but what I do know is that I plan on making one. I started this post mentioning that I didn't really feel like showing off the game this early. Well if you've gotten this far then i may as well leave a screenshot. Just remember that this is development artwork that you're seeing, this is a very early image of our engine.
